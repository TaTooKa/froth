Base Damage
===========

Weapons have a "base damage" listed as part of their description or stats. When you roll the die and succeed (result > Difficulty), this base damage is applied first to the :hoverxref:`Effect <effect>`, and then you count the reminder of the positive effect. 

For example, if a Weapon is listed as ``Mundane long sword (+1) - Base DMG 3``, and you roll against a Difficulty of 12 (let's say you've obtained a total of 15), your total Positive Effect would be: **3** (the weapons, Base DMG) **+ 3** (the Positive Effect) **= 6**.

Thus, weapons can have two "axes" of stats, the typical :hoverxref:`Item Bonus <items>`, and the **Base DMG**.
