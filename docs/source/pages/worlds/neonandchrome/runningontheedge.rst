Running on the Edge
-------------------

An assortment of rules and mechanics for **Neon & Chrome** and the cyberpunk genre.

.. _downtime:

Downtime
~~~~~~~~

The **Downtime phase** occurs between runs. Each character can do two *Downtime Activities* per phase.

▸ **HEALING**: Lie down in your hideout, visit a Ripperdoc shop, get treatment from a contact or ally, etc.
A *Moderate* Condition is healed with a single Downtime Activity. A *Severe* Condition requires two Downtime Activity expenditures (could be split in different Downtime phases if needed).

▸ **TRAINING**: Say what are you training on, and Gain 1 XP. May do this only once per Downtime Phase.

▸ **SHOPPING**: Spend your hard earned ฿ in **Gear**, **Cyberware** or **Programs**. A single shopping session (spending a Downtime Activity slot) lets you visit the *Shadow Markets*, the *Ripperdoc Shop* and the *Hackers’ Bazaar*.

▸ **PERSONAL PROJECT**: Work on something you care about or you want to do yourself. It could be repairing broken armor or other gear, trying to gain a new contact, investigating something important to you, dealing with personal stuff, etc.
Tell the GM what it is about and they will tell you if:

- it is something you can achieve in a single Downtime Activity, or 
- it requires an Adversary :hoverxref:`Challenge <challenges>`: The GM defines its level and HP, and asks for a roll with a related skill each Downtime Activity you spend on it. Once its HP is reduced to 0 or less, you finished the project. 

Tracking Consumables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tracking regular ammo or other consumables is not necessary. A character might run out on a :hoverxref:`Critical Failure <criticals>`, or when the GM considers it would make narrative sense.

The NET
~~~~~~~~

The NET is an information network that permeates the whole world and is mostly accessed wirelessly with different gadgets or cyber-implants. Most devices are connected between each other in a mesh-like network, or through a free public-service router. Two-Dimensional or text-based interfaces are no longer used; most interact with AR or VR.

**AR stands for “Augmented Reality”**. It can be accessed with a *SmartScreen*, *AR Glasses* or *Cyber-Eyes*. It is also known as *“Shallow mode”*.

**VR stands for “Virtual Reality”**. It can be accessed with *VR Goggles* or a *Neuralink*. It is also known as *“Deep mode”*. You gain +3 for Hacking tests, but because of the sensory deprivation, IRL actions are at -5 or outright impossible.

HACKING
^^^^^^^

Hacking is the process of trying to bypass electronic security systems or altering a computer’s (or its software’s) behavior. It’s done by rolling with the *Hacking* skill. A single attempt could take hours (and at -1), unless using a special Program, custom-tailored for the task. Doing so in “Shallow mode” takes seconds or minutes; Running them in “Deep mode” is faster (milliseconds or instantaneous).

.. csv-table:: Hacking Results

 "**CRITICAL FAILURE**: *Lockout* —you are kicked from the session and your position is compromised. If in “Deep mode”, gain a *Severe* Condition: “dumpshock damage”."
 "**FAILURE**. *Alert!* Choose one: you are locked out of the system OR your position is compromised. If in “Deep mode”, gain a *Moderate* Condition: “synapse scramble”."
 "**PARTIAL SUCCESS**. *Warning!* You achieve what you wanted but choose one: They are alerted of your presence and location now, OR you leave a trail that will be found later. If in “Deep mode”, gain a *Mild* Condition: “neural jolt”."
 "**SUCCESS**. You achieve what you intended to do."
 "**CRITICAL SUCCESS**. You achieve what you intended and you do it in half the time, or with increased effect."

DRONE PILOTING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drone Piloting also requires a wireless connection to the target and is similar to Hacking, but you use the *Piloting* skill.

Doing so in “Shallow Mode” is possible but not ideal (an overlay of the drone’s view appears in AR and the user must use gestures or some other form of analog control).

Doing so in “Deep Mode” gives you full immersion and you gain +3 for Piloting tests, but because of the sensory deprivation, IRL actions are at -5 or outright impossible.

Additionally, a DRONE JOCK can use their Combat/Spy Drones by gaining +2 for other skill checks, if it makes sense.
