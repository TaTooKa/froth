Basic Rules
===========

Players interpret Characters (AKA *Player-Characters*, or "PCs").

The *Game Master* ("GM") interprets the rest of the world and all *Non-Player-Characters* ("NPCs").

The game is a conversation. Players take turns to describe what their characters do. Then the GM declares if the action...

- just **happens** as described and what's the outcome
- is **impossible**, or what extra steps would be required
- has a **cost**, that the character must pay or suffer in order to perform the action
- presents a **risk**, that the player must accept before continuing
- has an **uncertain** outcome, and a failure state is interesting

If there is **risk** or **uncertainty** and the player decides to move forward, then they must **roll 2d6**, and:

- add +1 if they have a relevant *skill*, 
- add +1 if they have a relevant *item*,
- add +1 if *helped* by circumstances or by someone else (but they share any risk or consequence)

then check the total:

- a 6 or less is a **FAILURE**. Suffer full risk and/or don't get what they intended to do. 
- a 7 to 9 is a **PARTIAL SUCCESS**. They achieve the intended outcome but partially, and/or suffer a lesser version of the risk.
- a 10 or more is a **SUCCESS**. They get what they wanted, and avoid any risk.

Risk
----

A risk can be anything from a narrative consequence (something bad happens, the situation worsens, etc), a negative condition that the character receives, or in some dire situations, outright death. GMs must state clearly what the risk is before the dice are rolled.

**Negative Conditions** give a -1 each to any related roll (in actions in which the condition would adversely affect the character).

3 or more Conditions usually mean that the character risks death in their next attempt (at GM discretion).

Avoiding Risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to avoid a risk is to try another course of action. If that's not possible and/or the player still wants to move forward with that action, then they would suffer the full Risk in case of a FAILURE, or a lesser version of it in case of a PARTIAL SUCCESS. Only a full SUCCESS would grant them total avoidance of the Risk.

Defense
^^^^^^^

For risk of physical harm, characters can defend themselves by breaking some item they carry that could provide some sort of protection for the current situation. A broken item is useless (some could be repaired with time/tools/etc).

Difficulty
----------

Since there is a set range of outcomes for any roll (6-; 7~9; 10+), in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of an action, the GM can impose a modifier of ±X to a roll.

- If the character has some sort of **advantage** from an external circumstance, they gain +1 to the roll.
- If the character has some sort of **disadvantage** from an external circumstance, they recieve -1 to the roll.

These modifiers could increase to ±2 if the GM deems so (specially if there are more than one circumstance affecting the action), but should keep in mind that a ±2 would have a huge impact in a 2d6 roll. 

**Negative Conditions** already impose negative modifiers to character actions, which is another factor for the GM to consider when imposing difficulty penalties.
