Dying Sun
=========

*CENTURIES AGO, the world was a lush paradise of fantasy tales. But then came the ARCANE WARS, when the Archmages toppled kingdoms and their Defiling Sorcery desecrated the land into a broken wasteland. Now, even the Sun is dying.*

*Most folks struggle to adapt under the unwavering fist of the Sorcerer-Kings, rulers of the few remaining city-states. But not you: You are a wastelander, a survivor, and maybe even the only hope for those in need under the DYING SUN.*

DYING SUN is a World + Setting of post-apocalyptic survival fantasy, heavily influenced by **Dark Sun**, **Mad Max**, **Conan** and **Dune**.
