Characters
----------

Characters are usually the player avatars, the protagonists of the story.

.. _resistancepoints:

Characters begin at Level 1. They have a number of **Resistance Points** (RP) equal to **10 + Level**. Receiving “damage” reduces that amount of RP. When their RP reaches 0 or less, they are defeated.

.. admonition:: What does Resistance represent?

   The Resistance of a character is an abstract measure of their durability, or ability to stay in play with agency to alter the world around them. When RP reaches 0 or less, that character loses that ability. Narratively it could mean different things: being taken out, physically drained, socially depleted, unconscious, or even dead, depending on the context of the current scene.

   The GM usually telegraphs the outcome of an action in case of failure. When "death" is on the table, the GM should warn it clearly so that the player can correct course or risk their chances knowingly.

When a character is the target of a :hoverxref:`Negative Effect <effect>`, their player can choose between losing Resistance Points (RP) or taking a :hoverxref:`Condition <conditions>`:

- Effect 5 or less: lose that amount of RP, or receive a *Mild* Condition.
- Effect between 6 and 10: lose that amount of RP, or receive a *Moderate* Condition.
- Effect greater than 10: lose that amount of RP, or receive a *Severe* Condition.
