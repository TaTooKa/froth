Basic Rules
===========

.. note::

   These are **MY** basic rules for most of my approaches to a FROTH game.

The game is a conversation in which a collaborative story unfolds. Players create characters to be the protagonists in the narrative. One player is the Game Master (GM), who controls the non-player characters, environmental factors, passage of time, etc. The GM sets the scene, players say what their characters do, then the GM responds with the reaction of the world, and so forth. When a character attempts something whose outcome might be uncertain, the GM asks for a dice roll to see if the action succeeds or fails, and by how much.

.. admonition:: Types of Dice

   This system uses primarily a twenty-sided die for action resolution (the "d20"), although all of the other typical polyhedral dice can be used for different randomizers and weird specific rolls.

Action resolution
-----------------

Roll **d20** + Your :hoverxref:`Level <level>` ± :hoverxref:`modifiers <bonusesmaluses>` vs **Difficulty**.

- **Result = DN**: a ``stalemate``; no progress is made, time passes, etc
- **Result > DN**: ``success!`` The difference between the result and the DN is the *Positive Effect* (used for damage dealt, progress made, decrease in task duration, etc)
- **Result < DN**: ``failure!`` The difference between the DN and the result is the *Negative Effect* (used for damage received, progress unmade, increase in task duration, etc)

**Difficulty** = **10** + **Level** of obstacle / adversary / situation, ± :hoverxref:`modifiers <bonusesmaluses>`.

+------------+-----+--------+------+---------+
|    Level   | 1-3 |   4-6  |  7-9 |   10+   |
+============+=====+========+======+=========+
| Difficulty | Low | Medium | Hard | Extreme |
+------------+-----+--------+------+---------+

.. _effect:

Positive and Negative Effect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a player rolls the die, they need to add their Level + modifiers (see :hoverxref:`Bonuses & Maluses <bonusesmaluses>`) to that result and compare it to the Difficulty (The Difficulty might also have modifiers of its own, besides the Level). If they beat that number, they succeed and that difference in the Effect is “how well” they did (this amount is the *Positive Effect*). If they roll lower than the Difficulty, the difference is “how bad” they performed (this amount is the *Negative Effect*). 

.. tip::

   The GM is free to interpret these numbers following their gut, but as a rule of thumb, consider that a difference of 5 or less is not that big of a deal; a difference of 5~10 is important; a difference of 10+ is huge.

This amount of Effect is also used when dealing damage to a target's :hoverxref:`Resistance <resistancepoints>`, or when applying a :hoverxref:`Condition <conditions>`.
