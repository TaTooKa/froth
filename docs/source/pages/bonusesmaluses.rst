Modifiers
---------

Modifiers, AKA **Bonuses** & **Maluses**, are things that a character has (or affects them) and give a modifier to their rolls or its Difficulty for certain actions. They have 3 different ranks:

+-----------+--------------+-----------+
| MINOR: ±1 | MODERATE: ±3 | MAJOR: ±5 |
+-----------+--------------+-----------+

- Anything that gives you an advantage (a skill, an item, a special ability, a favorable circumstance) can be considered a **Bonus**, and adds its value to your roll result (or Difficulty if defending).
- Anything that gives you a disadvantage (a transient negative effect or debuff, a wound, a detrimental circumstance) can be considered a **Malus**, and subtracts its value from your roll result (or Difficulty if defending).

Bonuses & Maluses have different keywords, depending on their type and rank:

+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+
|  Type / Rank | Minor (±1) | Moderate (±3) | Major (±5) |
+==============+============+===============+============+
|     Skill    |    Adept   |     Expert    |   Master   |
+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+
| Item Quality |   Mundane  |   Masterwork  |  Legendary |
+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+
|   Condition  |    Mild    |    Moderate   |   Severe   |
+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+

Apart from giving a ±modifier to related actions, Bonuses and Maluses can sometimes give or take *narrative permission* to do something that would be impossible/possible otherwise.

**Skills** are Bonuses that represent trained abilities, backgrounds or professions that a character has. Examples: Adept Swordsman (+1), Expert Orator (+3), Kung-Fu Master (+5), Melee Combat Expert (+3).

**Items** are Bonuses that represent any object or tool that can give an advantage for an action. These can be weapons, protective gear, specialized equipment, etc. Examples: Mundane Short Sword (+1), Masterwork Thieves' Tools (+3), Legendary Shield (+5), Mundane Grappling Hook (+1).

**Conditions** are Maluses that represent negative hindrances like physical wounds, mental limitations, status effects, etc.  Examples: Mild laceration (-1), Moderate Embarrassment (-3), Severe Internal Bleeding (-5), Stunned (Mild, -1).

When a character is the target of a *Negative Effect*, their player can choose between losing Resistance Points (RP) or taking a Condition:

- Effect 5 or less: lose that amount of RP, or receive a *Mild* Condition.
- Effect between 6 and 10: lose that amount of RP, or receive a *Moderate* Condition.
- Effect greater than 10: lose that amount of RP, or receive a *Severe* Condition.
