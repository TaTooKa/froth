Dark Magic
==========

Magic is an esoteric art that is very dangerous even in the best case scenarios. It takes its energy from the life essence of everything around the caster. A magic-user knows how to tap just enough, to power their spells in a somewhat safe way.

Spells
~~~~~~

.. compound::
   
   Spells must be tattooed on the caster's body and recited at the time of execution. To create a Spell, generate a formula with a d6: 1-2: **Effect + Element**, 3-4: **Element + Form**, 5-6: **Effect + Form**. Then define it with the following tables, extrapolating function from its name.
   
   Roll d12 to generate the **Effect**.

Spellcasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The effect of "safe" magic is usually subtle. This means the effect is often temporary and low-impact, avoiding significant changes to the environment or the caster. Sorcerers avoid detection by casting subtle spells that go unnoticed. 
| Roll *+Sorcery* or a similar skill, vs a :hoverxref:`Low Difficulty <difficulty>` set by the GM. 
| On a *CRITICAL FAILURE*, a *Magical Mishap* occurs (see below).

| **DEFILING MAGIC** is the process to tap more than what's safe for greater power. Plants wither and die, soil goes infertile and dry, and creatures weaken and writhe. 
| When you choose to do so, add +3 to your roll if you defile a few meters around you, or +5 if you desecrate a bigger area. 
| The :hoverxref:`difficulty <difficulty>` is set by the GM, but usually it is *Medium* or *Hard*.
| The spell effect is stronger, but if you roll a *FAILURE* or you obtain a total result *equal to or higher than 20*, you trigger a *Magical Mishap*.

Magical Mishaps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roll d20 + the :hoverxref:`Negative Effect <effect>` (in case of Failure) or + the :hoverxref:`Positive Effect <effect>` (in case of a total result of 20+ while *Defiling*):

     - You speak and write gibberish until rest.
   * - 4-5
     - You start glowing, attracting attention.

     - The weather worsens locally, following you around, until rest.
   * - 8-9

   * - 10
     - Every magically-attuned being in the area gains a ``Disoriented (Mild, -1)`` Condition.
   * - 11
     - An anomalous light beam triggers at your location; a magical beacon that attracts any arcane-attuned being.
   * - 12
     - One of your body parts or facial features changes into that of an animal (detrimental/awkward), until rest.
   * - 13
     - The spell targets a random, unwanted target.

     - The spell does the opposite of the intended effect, to your detriment.
   * - 21
     - An Item you carry (or that of a nearby ally) is broken or spent and must be repaired or refilled.
   * - 22
     - A localized earthquake occurs: the ground cracks, structures collapse, people is hurt, etc. It lasts for 1 minute, complicating everyone with a ``Moderate (-3)`` Condition.
   * - 24
     - The area turns into an arcane nega-zone where no spells can be cast, for a year.
   * - 25
     - An entity of horror is summoned. It is angry and has no master.
   * - 26+
     - You tear a gash in reality. The pitch-black tear grows larger by the hour, until it devours everything that exists.

Rituals
~~~~~~~

Some special or powerful effects cannot be cast instantly (or be encoded as spells), and require a more involved process, known as a **Ritual**. Magic Rituals can potentially achieve any desired effect the caster can imagine. 

The GM sets **1 to 4 conditions** before you roll:

- It's going to take hours/days/weeks/months
- You must perform it at a special place/time
- First you must do [X] or get help from [X]
- The effect will be unreliable or limited
- You and your allies will risk danger from [X]
- You'll have to sacrifice or consume [X] to do it
