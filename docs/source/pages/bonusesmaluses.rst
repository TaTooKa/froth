.. container:: modifiers

   Modifiers, AKA **Bonuses** & **Maluses**, are things that a character has (or affects them) and give a modifier to their rolls or its Difficulty for certain actions. 
   
   They have 3 different ranks:

   +-----------+--------------+-----------+
   | MINOR: ±1 | MODERATE: ±3 | MAJOR: ±5 |
   +-----------+--------------+-----------+

   - Anything that gives you an advantage (a skill, an item, a special ability, a favorable circumstance) can be considered a **Bonus**, and adds its value to your roll result (or Difficulty if defending).
   - Anything that gives you a disadvantage (a transient negative effect or debuff, a wound, a detrimental circumstance) can be considered a **Malus**, and subtracts its value from your roll result (or Difficulty if defending).

Bonuses & Maluses have different keywords, depending on their type and rank:

+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+
|  Type / Rank | Minor (±1) | Moderate (±3) | Major (±5) |
+==============+============+===============+============+
|     Skill    |    Adept   |     Expert    |   Master   |
+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+
| Item Quality |   Mundane  |   Masterwork  |  Legendary |
+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+
|   Condition  |    Mild    |    Moderate   |   Severe   |
+--------------+------------+---------------+------------+

.. _skills:

**Skills** are Bonuses that represent trained abilities, backgrounds or professions that a character has. Examples: Adept Swordsman (+1), Expert Orator (+3), Kung-Fu Master (+5), Melee Combat Expert (+3).

.. _items:

**Items** are Bonuses that represent any object or tool that can give an advantage for an action. These can be weapons, protective gear, specialized equipment, etc. Examples: Mundane Short Sword (+1), Masterwork Thieves' Tools (+3), Legendary Shield (+5), Mundane Grappling Hook (+1).

.. _conditions:

**Conditions** are Maluses that represent negative hindrances like physical wounds, mental limitations, status effects, etc.  Examples: Mild laceration (-1), Moderate Embarrassment (-3), Severe Internal Bleeding (-5), Stunned (Mild, -1).

.. note::

   Apart from (or instead of) giving a ±modifier to related actions, Bonuses and Maluses can sometimes give or take *narrative permission* to do something that would be impossible/possible otherwise.

   i.e.: you cannot chop down a tree if you don't have an axe. Any attempt would automatically fail (no roll required). If you do have it, you have *narrative permission* to attempt chopping down the tree, and if the Item is a **Mundane Axe (+1)**, you would also get a +1 modifier to your roll.
