Dark Magic
==========

Magic is an esoteric art that is very dangerous even in the best case scenarios. It takes its energy from the life essence of everything around the caster. A magic-user knows how to tap just enough, to power their spells in a somewhat safe way.

Spells
~~~~~~

.. compound::
   
   Spells must be tattooed on the caster's body and recited at the time of execution. To create a Spell, generate a formula with a d6: 1-2: **Effect + Element**, 3-4: **Element + Form**, 5-6: **Effect + Form**. Then define it with the following tables, extrapolating function from its name.
   
   Roll d12 to generate the **Effect**.

Spellcasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The effect of "safe" magic is usually subtle. This means the effect is often temporary and low-impact, avoiding significant changes to the environment or the caster. Sorcerers avoid detection by casting subtle spells that go unnoticed. 
| Roll *+Sorcery* or a similar skill, vs a :hoverxref:`Low Difficulty <difficulty>` set by the GM. 
| On a CRITICAL FAILURE, a *Magical Mishap* occurs (see below).

| **DEFILING MAGIC** is the process to tap more than what's safe for greater power. Plants wither and die, soil goes infertile and dry, and creatures weaken and writhe. 
| When you choose to do so, add +3 to your roll if you defile a few meters around you, or +5 if you desecrate a bigger area. 
| The :hoverxref:`difficulty <difficulty>` is set by the GM, but usually it is **Medium** or **Hard**.
| The spell effect is stronger, but if you roll a **FAILURE** or you obtain a total result **equal to or higher than 20**, you trigger a *Magical Mishap*.

Magical Mishaps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roll d6 twice in the following table:

+----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|  1-3                                                           | 4-6                                                       |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 | The spell affects much more/less than intended.            | 1 | Your eyes (or ears) bleed; you are blind (or deaf).   |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 2 | You are ``Physically Sapped (Mild, -1)``.                  | 2 | You lose the ability to understand any spoken word.   |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 3 | A nearby ally/item is adversely affected by the spell.     | 3 | Everyone you see looks and sounds like yourself.      |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 4 | An entity of horror is summoned. It has no master.         | 4 | You suffer memory loss and blackouts.                 |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 5 | The weather worsens locally, following you around.         | 5 | Your mind switches bodies with that of a nearby ally. |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+
| 6 | An arcane nexus beacon triggers at your location.          | 6 | You can hear people's thoughts. Very loud.            |
+---+------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------+

Most of these effects act as *injuries* (a *Mild condition* (-1)); they heal over time (or with proper rest), but **always leave a scar**.

Rituals
~~~~~~~

Some special or powerful effects cannot be cast instantly (or be encoded as spells), and require a more involved process, known as a **Ritual**. Magic Rituals can potentially achieve any desired effect the caster can imagine. 

The GM sets **1 to 4 conditions** before you roll:

- It's going to take hours/days/weeks/months
- You must perform it at a special place/time
- First you must do [X] or get help from [X]
- The effect will be unreliable or limited
- You and your allies will risk danger from [X]
- You'll have to sacrifice or consume [X] to do it
